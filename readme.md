# RastreGranTor
This project pretends to build a powerful scolarships & grants search tool, it's based on the parsing of different websites, extracting the useful information.

# How To Use It?
It's easy! All you have to do is downloading the scripts AND the 'max.txt' file, having python installed on your computer, and run genericScript.py script (what a redundance!).

Then, the script will start having babies! Little exit_N.txt files (where N is a number). Each file is the information extracted from a website, so you can check it confortably.

# Feed Me More!
You can also help building this tool by adding webparsers... In order to do that, you will need a bit of python scripting abilities, as well as some webparsing knowledge. If you have got all that and a really big heart, you can make the RastreGranTor grew better, faster and stronger like it was Kanye West.

How? You can script parsers and upload them to this repository, named as scrapperN.py, where N is the number that you can find in the 'max.txt' file. When you have already uploaded the code, you can just change that N number to the next one (N+1) inside the 'max.txt' file and your job will be done!

It's amazing, isn't it?
